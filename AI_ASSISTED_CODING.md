# AI Assisted Coding

This document outlines the enforced rules and guidelines for using AI-assisted coding tools within this project. The goal is to ensure that the code generated by AI tools adheres to the project's coding standards, maintains code quality, and integrates seamlessly with existing codebases.

You may use AI-assisted coding tools such as GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, or other similar tools to help you write code faster and more efficiently. However, it is **mandatory** to follow these rules to ensure that the generated code meets the project's requirements.

## Official AI Rule Files

You **MUST** use the following instruction files as official instructions for AI-assisted coding tools:

- [`ai-rules/code_standards.instructions.md`](ai-rules/code_standards.instructions.md) - Code style, structure, and organization standards
- [`ai-rules/coding_rules.instructions.md`](ai-rules/coding_rules.instructions.md) - Quality, security, and NestJS patterns

**These files are MANDATORY for all AI-assisted code generation.** Review and understand all rules before using any AI-assisted coding tools in this project.

## Code Review Checklist

Before committing code generated with AI-assisted tools, verify:

- [ ] No comments, console.logs, or debugging code
- [ ] All files follow naming conventions
- [ ] Controllers/Services are under line limits
- [ ] All inputs are validated
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Security rules are followed
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined
- [ ] CQRS pattern used for complex operations
- [ ] Module structure is correct
- [ ] Exception handling is in place
- [ ] Tests are included for new code

## Enforcement Strategy

### For Developers

1. **Before using AI tools**: Read all files in `ai-rules/`
2. **During code generation**: Provide AI tools with the instruction files
3. **After generation**: Review code against this checklist
4. **Before commit**: Ensure all rules are followed

### For Code Reviewers

1. Verify all points in the checklist above
2. Request changes if rules are violated
3. Reference this document in review comments
4. Flag security violations immediately

## Violations & Remediation

| Violation            | Severity | Action                     |
|----------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Comments in code     | High     | Remove immediately         |
| Security issues      | Critical | Block merge, fix required  |
| Type violations      | High     | Request refactor           |
| File size violations | Medium   | Request split              |
| Naming convention    | Medium   | Request rename             |
| Missing validation   | Critical | Add validators             |
| Exposed secrets      | Critical | Remove, rotate credentials |
